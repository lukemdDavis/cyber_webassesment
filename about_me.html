         <h1> A little about me </h1>
             <p>
                Originally born in the USA, I moved to Australia with my mom and sister when I was 10 and
                lived in Cairns for 4 years before moving to the sunshine coast. Completed highschool at ST
                Andrew's anglican college. Moved out of home working 2 jobs 1 at HJs and the other at 
                plants plus bagging materials for a dollar a bag. I then got offered a position as a labourer at
                shadforth civil construction after 3 months then made my way on to the machines bobcat, 
                loader, roller and moxy. I was then looking to get away from civil construction and did a dual
                diploma in international business and business. I found that the dual diploma was to braude 
                and I wasn't really interested. I started trying code online and always loved the idea but 
                thought it was too late until I stumbled across this course.
